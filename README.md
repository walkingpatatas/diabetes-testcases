# Diabetes Prediction Using Gaussian Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates the use of Gaussian Naive Bayes, a machine learning algorithm, to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on certain medical measurements. The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook and uses the `scikit-learn` library for machine learning tasks.

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using their medical data. The dataset used includes features such as glucose levels and blood pressure. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation using accuracy, recall, and precision metrics.

Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Train-test split for model validation
- Implementation of Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, and precision
- User input for predicting diabetes status
